The provided C code implements an iterative insertion of 50,000 random integers into a binary search tree (BST) while measuring the time taken for this operation. It begins by including necessary libraries for input/output, memory allocation, and time measurement, and defines a `Node` structure to represent each node in the tree, containing data and pointers to left and right children. In the `main` function, an array is initialized to store random numbers generated using a seeded random number generator. The program then creates an empty BST and records the start time before iteratively inserting each number from the array into the tree using the `insertIterative` function. This function creates a new node, traverses the tree to find the appropriate position, and ensures no duplicates are added. After all insertions, the elapsed time is calculated and printed, showcasing the efficiency of the BST for organizing and inserting data.
